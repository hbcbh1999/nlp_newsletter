**On Code and Data...**

Earlier last week, Facebook AI research team released wav2letter — “a simple and efficient end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system.” The toolkit provides pre-trained models that can get you started right away with transcribing speech. Their accompanying paper can also be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03193).
